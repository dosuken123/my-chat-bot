  Text embedding models

  Another key part of retrieval has become creating embeddings for documents.
  Embeddings capture the semantic meaning of text, allowing you to quickly and efficiently find other pieces of text that are similar. LangChain provides integrations with over 25 different embedding providers and methods, from open-source to proprietary API, allowing you to choose the one best suited for your needs.
  LangChain exposes a standard interface, allowing you to easily swap between models.

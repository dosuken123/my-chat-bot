  Document transformers

  A key part of retrieval is fetching only the relevant parts of documents.
  This involves several transformation steps in order to best prepare the documents for retrieval.
  One of the primary ones here is splitting (or chunking) a large document into smaller chunks.
  LangChain provides several different algorithms for doing this, as well as logic optimized for specific document types (code, markdown, etc).
